## Open Source Etiquette Summary

This document provides guidance for new contributors to open source projects (OSPs). Here are the key points:

### Core Principles

Be kind and polite to all contributors, even when you disagree

Be supportive and respectful in all communications

Avoid assumptions about other contributor's knowledge, background, or experience

Follow the Code of Conduct. It varies from project to project so make sure you refer to it every time you contribute.

#### Effective Contribution

Understand your motivations for contributing (skill improvement, bug fixes, helping others)

Choose productive contributions that align with project goals

Make focused changes - one issue per PR, one topic per issue

Read documentation first before asking questions

Ask questions in appropriate channels rather than creating issues for every query

### Working with the Community

Be patient - many contributors work in their free time

Be timely when responding to others

Respect decisions made by project moderators

Avoid controversial subjects and potentially offensive language

Report inappropriate behavior using the mechanisms outlined in the Code of Conduct

### Additional general points 

Communicate formally and avoid shortcuts in text.

Avoid enquiring personal details and keep it as proffesional as possible.

Open source is always a place to learn and upskill. Refrain from cheating and copying.
